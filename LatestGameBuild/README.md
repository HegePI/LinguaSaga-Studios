# Built Game

This contains the game compiled from Unity, (source can be found in [Game](https://github.com/HegePI/LinguaSaga-Studios/tree/main/Game)). To run this, make sure that the local server is running (please see [middleman](https://github.com/HegePI/LinguaSaga-Studios/tree/main/middleman) on instructions on starting the server), and then start linguasaga-b1.x86_64.

Currently, Linux is the only supported platform.
